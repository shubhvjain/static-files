## Intro to Intelligent Agents
### Agent

- What is an agent ?
  - takes in input and performs an action
  - reads input via sensors
    - what kind of input ? : info about the environment in which it is placed
    - "Precept sequence" : the history of all input so far
  - performs actions via actuators
    - what is the impact of that action ? : the environment is modified
    - how does the agent decide what action to perform ?
      - this is described in the "agent program"
      - ... which is the implementation of the mathematical "agent function"
      - precept sequence ---> [agent function] --> action
      - another way to represent it is as a table with cols : "precept sequence" and "action" ... this can be an infinitely large table
### Rational agent


- our aim is to make good agents
- what makes an agent good or bad? : we define a good behavior as being rational
-  a rational agent does the right thing
  - how do we know if the agent is doing the right thing ?
  - by checking if the actions it performed as desirable for the environment
  - this is done by evaluating the sequence of environment state. This is the "Performance measure" of the rational agent
- Defining a rational agent
  - for each precept sequence, a rational agent selects an action that maximizes the performance measure, given the evidence of the agents  knowledge of the environment and the precept sequence
  - this means rationality depend on
    - performance measure
    - agent's prior knowledge of the env
    - actions agent can perform
    - percept seq
  - information gathering is also an imp part of rationality
    - performing actions to modify future percepts
    - this increases agents knowledge about the env
  - Rationality is different from omniscience
    - omniscient means knowing the outcome of each action... which is not possible in reality
    - rational agent depends on percept sequence to date
  - rational agent must also learn from what it percives
    - agent may have some prior knowledge but as it becomes more experienced, it's knowledge must also be augmented
    - a rational agent is "autonomous" if it depends less on a priori knowledge and more on its own learned expeience
### Nature of environment


- an extensive way to describe the task environment
  - what is task environment ? : the problem that the agent is trying to solve
  - the PEAS description
    - Performance Measure
    - Environment
    - Actuator
    - Sensors
- various ways to classify the task environment
  - fully vs partially observable
    - fully observable: if agent's sensor can access all the aspects of the environment relevant to take an action
    - partially observed : full state of env not accessible ... due to some reason like noise/inaccuate sensors
agent has to keep an internal state of the env
    - unobservable env : if agent has no sensors
  - single agent vs multiagent
      - example
        - single agent : agent solving a crossword puzzle
	- multiagent: driver , agent playing chess
      - in multiagent env, we need to decide if the agent treats other enties in the env as agents or just objects
      - multiagent env can be competitive or cooperative
  - deterministic vs stochastic
    - deterministic : next state of the environment can be completely determined by the current state and the action
    - stochastic : some uncertainty in determining the next env state
    - real world is mostly partially observable and Stochastic
    - non deterministic vs stochastic:  stochastic implies uncertainty is quantified  via probability
    - uncertain environment : not fully observable or not deterministic
  - episodic vs sequential
    - episodic
      - agent's experience is divided into atomic episodes
        - agents gets input and performs action in each episode
        - next episode does not depend on the last one
      - example :identifying defective pieces on an assembly line
    - sequential
      - current decisions  can affect future decisions
      - example: chess,driving
  - static vs dynamic
    - static : agent need not keep track to time while taking a decision as the env will remain same
      - example: solving crossword puzzle
    - dynamic : env can change while the agent is still deciding
      - agent has to continuously watch the env for changes
      - if the env changed, it is said the agent did not perform any action
      - example :  taxi driving
    - semi-dynamic: env might not change over time but the agent performance score may change
      - example : chess under a timer
  - discrete vs continuous
    - this classification can apply to
      - the state of the env
        - example :  discrete : chess (distinct states), continuous : taxi driving 
      - how time is handled
      - percepts, actions of the agent
        - example : discrete : chess (finite moves) , continuous : driving (steering angle )
   - known vs unknown
     - this classification applies to the agent 's knowledge of the env
     - known env : the outcome of the all actions on the env are known
     - unknown env : agent not aware of the env, it must learn about it 
     - known unknown vs fully partially observable : a known env can be fully or partially observable
### Working of an agent


- developing the agent program
- agent = architecture + program
  - architecture :  the computing device
  - program : how the agent takes action
    - many types ; have same structure
      - input: current percept
      - dosen't the agent program depend on percept sequence ?
        - yes. if the program needs percept sequence , it must remember on it's own
      - output : action
    - programs combines certain components to generate action
- agent program types
  - Simple reflex agent
    -  selects action based on current input ; ignores percept seq
    - actions based on condition-action rule : if "condition" , then "do this action"
    - limited intelligence
    - require fully observable env ; otherwise may have problems
  - Model based reflex agent
    - the big question is how to handle partial observability in simple reflex agents ?
      - by keeping an internal state of the env
      - we need  to model the world : how the world evolves independently and how the next state of the world depends on the current state and the action
      - then use the current state in the rule based condition to find next action
  - Goal based agents
    - actions may not depend only on the current state ... it must also have a goal
    - example: taxi need a destination
    - goals can either be reached by a single action or a sequence of actions
    - decision making is different from reflex agents: it requires consideration of future
    - more flexible
      - knowledge on which decisions made is explicit.
      - this means it can be modified
  - Utility based agent
    - multiple  action sequence may lead to the goal. but which is the most efficient  ?
    - utility function : an internalization of the performance measure that allows agent to measure utility value for a sequence of world state ...to compare which sequence of actions is better
  - learning agents
    - this is how most agent program come into being : by building a learning machine and then teaching it
    - this allows agents to work initially in unknown env and learn to get better
    - components of a general learning agent
      - critic : determines how the agent is doing based on an external fixed performance standard
      - learning element : resp for making improvements; using feedback from critic
      - performance element : responsible for selecting the action
      - problem generator
        - suggests exploratory actions
        - to explore and do sub optimal actions in the short run to get better in the long run
- the representation of the environment in the agent program
  - different components of the agent program can represent the env in different ways
  - atomic representation
    - each state of the world is indivisible
    - example : for route finding, all cities on the map are atomic
    - used in areas of : searching and planning,  HMM
  - factored representation
    - splitting the state into a fixed set of variables /attributes
    - used in areas : CSP, logic
  - structural representation
    - describing relationship among various objects

### Uninformed search strategies


### Informed search

### Local search


### Adversarial Search


  

## Constraint satisfcation problem
  
## Logic based Agents
### Basic concepts of logic
 
- 1- Representing knowledge
  - 1- Syntax
    - What make a sentence legal ?
    - Formula : a legal sentence in the logic 
  - 2- Semantics
    - Which sentences are true under which assignment ?
    - E.g. : under the assignment $ \phi =  \\{W=T,S=F \\}$, the $ \phi \models W $ and $ \phi \nvDash W \implies S$ 
- 2 - Reasoning about knowledge 
  - 1- Entitlement 
    - Symbol: $A \models B$ (means B is entailed by A)
    - For all $\phi$ with $\phi \models A$ , then $\phi \models B$
    - E.g. : $P \land (P \implies Q) \models Q$
    - What can we conclude from a sentence ?
  - 2- Deduction
    - Symbol: $A \vdash_c B$ (means B can be derived from A)
    - Which statement B can be derived from A using a set of inference rules C 
- 3- Two imp properties 
  - Soundness  : If A deduces B , A also entails B
  - Completeness : If A entails B , A also deduces B
  
### Propostional logic $PL_0$

- 1- Syntax
  - A well formed formula is made from 
    - $V_0$ : set of Propositional variables 
    - $\sum_0$ : set of constants and connectives
      - connectives :  $\neg$ (Negation) , $\land$ (Conjunction),  $\lor$ (Disjunction) ,  $\implies$ (implication) ,  $\iff$ (equivalence/biimplication)
      - Constants  : $T,F$
  - $wff_0(V_0)$ : a set of well formed formulas made using  $V_0$ and $\sum_0$
  - atomic formula  : Without any connectives , Else the formula is complex 
  - literal  : Atom or a negated atom (A or $\neg A$)
  - Grammar for $PL^0$ : See notes
- 2 - Semantics 
  - Model $M = \{ D_0, J \}$
    - $D_0= {T, F}$ is the universe
    - J is the interperation : Assigns $D_0$ values  to essential connectives
      - $J(\neg) : D_0 \to D_0; T \to F , F \to T$
      - $J(\land) : D_0 \times D_0 \to D_0; (a,b) \to T \text{ iff }a = b = T$
      - Other connectives can be defined using these essential connectives 
  - Variable assignment : $\varphi : V_0 \to D_0$ (assigning a value to a prop var)
  - Value function : $J_{\varphi} : wf_0(V_0) \to D_0 $ (assign a value to a sentence. Done recursively )
    - Base case: $J_{\varphi}(P) = \varphi(P)$
    - For neg : $J(\neg A) = J(\neg)(J_{\varphi}(A))$
    - For and : $J_{\varphi}(A \land B) = J(\land) (J_{\varphi}(A),J_{\varphi}(B))$
    - Other connectives are converted to these 2 base connectives
- 3- Identities
  - Idenpotence  : $a \land a = a$ , $a \lor a = a$
  - identity: $a \land T = a$, $a \lor F = a$
  - Absorption : $a \land F = F$, $a \lor T = T$
  - Commutativity  : $a \land b = b \land a$ , $a \lor b = b \lor a$
  - Associativity : $a \land (b \land c)  = (a \land b )  \land c$, $a \lor (b \lor c)  = (a \lor b )  \lor c$
  - Distributivity : $a \land (b \lor c) = (a \land b)\lor (a \land c)$, $a \lor (b \land c) = (a \lor b)\land (a \lor c)$
  - Demorgan : $\neg(a \land b)= \neg a \lor \neg b$, $\neg(a \lor b)= \neg a \land \neg b$
  - Definitions
    - Or : $a \lor b = \neg (\neg a \land \neg b) $
    - Implication : $a \implies b = \neg a \lor b$
    - Biconditional : $a \iff b  = (a \implies b) \land  (b \implies a)$
- 4 - Properties of formulas “A” for some model M = {U,J}
  - True under $\varphi$ : If $J_{\varphi}(A) = T$
  - False under $\varphi$ : If $J_{\varphi}(A) = F$
  - Satisfiable in M : Iff $J_{\varphi}(A) = T$ for some $\varphi$, Eg : $x \lor x$
  - Valid in M :  Iff $J_{\varphi}(A) = T$ for all $\varphi$ ,  Eg : $x \lor \neg x$
  - Falsifiable in M : Iff $J_{\varphi}(A) = F$ for some $\varphi$, Eg : $x \lor x $  
  - Unsatisfiable :  Iff $J_{\varphi}(A) = F$ for all $\varphi$, Eg: $x \land \neg x$
  - Entailment in $PL_0$ : A entails B iff $J_{\varphi}(B) = T   $ for all $\varphi$ with $J_{\varphi}(A) = T$
### Inference in Propositional logic

- 1- the 2 imp properties of a logical calculi C:
  - Soundness/Correctness : if  $H \models A$, whenever $H \vdash A$
  - Completeness: if $H \vdash A$ whenever $H \models A$
- 2 - Hilbert Calculus : A Simple formal system
  - 2 axioms
    - H1 : $A \implies (B \implies A)$
    - H2 : $A \implies (B \implies C) \implies ((A \implies B) \implies (A \implies C))$
  - 2 inference rules
    - Modus ponnen : $\underline{A, A \implies B } \\ B$
    - Substitution : $\underline{A} \\ \[ B/X \](A)$ 
- 3 - Natural deduction Calculus by Gentzen ($ND_0$)
    - Given set $H \subseteq \text{wff}_0(V_0) $ (set of assumptions) and C (conclusion), $H \vdash _{ND_0} C$ , iff there is a derivation tree whose leaves are in H
    - Inference Rules
      - Conjunction : $ \boxed{ \land I :  \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{A} \AxiomC{B} \BinaryInfC{ $A \land B$ }  \end{prooftree} } \quad  \boxed{ \land_{El} :  \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A \land B$ } \UnaryInfC{ $A$ }  \end{prooftree}  }   \quad \boxed{ \land_{Er} :  \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A \land B$ } \UnaryInfC{ $B$ }  \end{prooftree} } $
      - Implication : $ \boxed{ \to_I :  \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{[$A$]} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$B$} \UnaryInfC{$A \to B$} \end{prooftree} } \quad  \boxed{ \to_{E}  :   \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{A} \AxiomC{$A \to B$ } \BinaryInfC{ $B$ }  \end{prooftree}  }    $
        - $ {\to}_I$  derives B from A using hypothetical reasoning
        - A is the local hypothesis
        - $\to $ discharges the hypothesis (A) and concludes $A \to B$
      - Disjunction :
        - $ \boxed{ \lor_{Il} :   \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A$} \UnaryInfC{$A \lor B$}  \end{prooftree}   }  \quad \boxed{ \lor_{Ir} :   \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$B$} \UnaryInfC{$A \lor B$}  \end{prooftree} }  $
        -  $ \boxed{  \lor_{E} : \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A \lor B$} \AxiomC{[$A$]} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$C$} \AxiomC{[$B$]} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$C$} \TrinaryInfC{$C$} \end{prooftree} } $ 
      - Negation : $\boxed{ \neg_{I} :   \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{[$A$]} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$C$}  \noLine \UnaryInfC{$\neg C$} \UnaryInfC{$\neg A $}  \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{  \neg_{E} : \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A$} \AxiomC{$\neg A$}  \BinaryInfC{$\bot$} \end{prooftree} } $
      - Bi-implication  : 
    - 2 kinds of rules for each connective :
      - Introduction : to prove a sentence with some main logical operator 
      - Elimination : to prove part of a sentence this operator os a part of 
    - Deduction theorem for $ND_0$ : $H, A \vdash_{ND0} B$, iff $H \vdash_{ND0} A \implies B$
- 4 - Machine oriented calculus intro : 
  - 1- Unsatisfiability theorem :
    - if $H \models A$ iff $H \cup {\neg A}$ is unsatisfiable
    - satisfiable : a formula is satisfiable if it os true under some assignment of its variable
    - how to find value of variables that make a formula satisfiable (SAT problem)
    - $H \models A$ (H entails A) iff $H \cup {\neg A}$ is unsatisfiable i.e. this is not true for any assignment 
  - 2- Theorem proving
    - given a formal systemm theorem proving is determining whether $H \vdash C$ for a conjuecture C and hypothesis H
    - automated theorem proving : devloping calculi for the logic system and program that given a set of H and A determines whether $H \vdash_{c} A$
      - ATM induces a seach problem, P = {S,A,T,I,G}
      - S : set of formulas
      - A : actions (inference rules from calculi C)
      - I : initial state , I = {H}
      - G : goal state, ($A \in S$)
      - the problem is that this seach is not efficient (no good heristics)
    - givn a conjecture A, Hypothesis H, Test calculi T tries to derive : $H,\neg A \vdash_T \bot$ instead of $H \vdash_T A $
      - $\neg A$ is unsatifsiable iff A is valid
      - such derivation is called refutation of A
  - 3- Normal forms:
    - Clause Normal Form (aka Conjunctive normal form) :
      - Clause : $C = C_1 \land C_2 \land \dots$ (in set notations : $\{C_1,C_2,\dots \}$)
      - where $C_i = D_1 \lor D_2 \lor D_3 \lor \dots$
      - where $D_i$ = literal
      - e.g. : $(A \lor \neg B) \land (C \lor D) \land (E \lor \neg A)$
      - any formula can be converted to CNF , but usually the size blows up
- 5 - Analytical Tableau ($T_0$) :
  - construct a tree  : each labelled node is a sub formula to be proved/refuted
  - refutation tableaux : show that the negation of a formula A cannot be satisfied => A can be satisfied
  - inf rule introduces new nodes and branches in the tree
  - if a branch leads to contradication, that branch is closed
  - the proof is complete when all branches are closed
  - Inference rules :
    - Conjunction :  $\boxed{   \begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$A \land B$}  \UnaryInfC{A} \noLine \UnaryInfC{B} \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{    \begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$\neg(A \land B)$}  \UnaryInfC{$\neg A \quad | \quad \neg B$}  \end{prooftree}  } $
    - Negation : $\boxed{\begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$A$}  \UnaryInfC{$\neg A$}  \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{ \begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$\neg A$}  \UnaryInfC{$A$}  \end{prooftree}} \quad \boxed{ \begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{A} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$\neg A$} \UnaryInfC{$\bot$}   \end{prooftree}} $
    - Disjunction : $\boxed{\begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$A \lor B$}  \UnaryInfC{$A \quad | \quad B$}  \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{  \begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$\neg(A \lor B)$}  \UnaryInfC{$\neg A$} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$\neg B$} \end{prooftree}}$
    - Implication :  $\boxed{\begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$A \to B$}  \UnaryInfC{$\neg A \quad | \quad B$}  \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{  \begin{prooftree}  \AxiomC{$\neg(A \to B)$}  \UnaryInfC{$A$} \noLine \UnaryInfC{$\neg B$} \end{prooftree}}$
    - Biconditional :
  - Some related terms :
    - saturated tableau : no further rules can be applied to expand the tree further
    - Closed branch : if $\bot$ is at the end , else open
    - closed Tableau : iff all branches are closed
    - A is a tabluau theorem iff there exists a closed tableau with $\neg A$ at the root
  - in proof system, we check the validity by checking of the inference rules are valid
  -  a test caclucli is refutation sound iff its inference rules preserve satisfiability and the goal formula is unsatisfiable
  - soundness in tableau : $T_0$ is sound i.e. $\phi \subseteq wff_0(V_0)$ is valid iff there is a closed tableua T for $\neg \phi$
  - completeness in tableau : $T_0$ is complete i.e. if $\phi \subseteq wff_0(V_0)$ is valid, then there is a closed tableau T for $\neg \phi$
  - $T_0$ terminates i.e. every $T_0$ tableau becomes satureated after finitely many rule application 
  - example : prove $(p \to (q \to r))\to((p \to q)\to(p \to r) )$
    - $ \neg\{ (p \to (q \to r))\to((p \to q)\to(p \to r) )\} $
    - $p \to ( q \to r)$
    - $\neg ( (p \to q) \to (p \to r) )$
    - $p \to q$
    - $\neg ( p \to r )$
    - $p$
    - $\neg r$
    - $\neg p \quad |_1 \quad q $
    - $\bot \quad |_1 \quad  \neg p \quad |_2 \quad  q \to r  $
    - $\quad  \quad |_1 \quad  \bot \quad |_2 \quad  \neg q \quad  |_3 \quad r   $
    - $\quad  \quad |_1 \quad   \quad \quad |_2 \quad  \bot \quad |_3 \quad  \bot  $
- 6 - Resolution ($R_0$) :
  - also a refuation method
  - preprocessing step : convert all forumlas to Clause normal form
  - goal : derive empty clause $\square$ (which is unsatisfiable)
  - Inference rule (just 1): $\boxed{  \dfrac{  (P^T \lor A ) , (P^F \lor B )}{ A \lor B}  }$
    - $P^F, P^T$ are cut literals
    - this inference rule adds resolvent clause in the Knowledge base
  - Resolution refutation: S (Clause set) , $R_0$  derviation of $\square$ from S  : $S \vdash_{R0} \square $
  - this method is based on the tautologic equivalence of the follwoing formula : $(\neg p \lor q) \land (p \lor r) \equiv (\neg p \lor q) \land (p \lor r) \land ( q \lor r) $
  - example : $(p \to (q \to r))\to ( (p \to q) \to (p \to r) ) $
    - 1st :convert the negation to CNF :
      - $\neg((p \to (q \to r))\to ( (p \to q) \to (p \to r) )) $
      - $\neg (  \neg(p \to (q \to r)) \lor (  (p \to q) \to (p \to r) )    )$
      - $\neg  \neg(p \to (q \to r)) \land  \neg(  (p \to q) \to (p \to r) ) $
      - $(p \to (q \to r)) \land  \neg(  (p \to q) \to (p \to r) ) $
      - $(\neg p \lor (\neg q \lor r)) \land  \neg(  \neg (p \to q) \lor (p \to r) ) $
      - $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r} \land  ((\neg p \lor q) \land  \neg (\neg p \lor r) ) $
      - $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r} \land  ((\neg p \lor q) \land   (\neg \neg p \land \neg r) ) $
      - $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r} \land  \boxed{\neg p \lor q}  \land   \boxed{p} \land \boxed{\neg r}  $
    - now apply the inf rule to add more resolvants :
      - $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r}_1 , \boxed{\neg p \lor q}_2  ,   \boxed{p}_3 , \boxed{\neg r}_4  $
      - resolve 2 and 3 :   $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r}_1 , \boxed{\neg p \lor q}_2  ,   \boxed{p}_3 , \boxed{\neg r}_4  , \boxed{q}_5 $
      - resolve 1 and 5 :  $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r}_1 , \boxed{\neg p \lor q}_2  ,   \boxed{p}_3 , \boxed{\neg r}_4  , \boxed{q}_5 , \boxed{\neg p \lor r}_6$
      - resolve 3 and 6 :  $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r}_1 , \boxed{\neg p \lor q}_2  ,   \boxed{p}_3 , \boxed{\neg r}_4  , \boxed{q}_5 , \boxed{\neg p \lor r}_6 ,\boxed{r}_7$
      - resolve 4 and 7 :  $\boxed{\neg p \lor \neg q \lor r}_1 , \boxed{\neg p \lor q}_2  ,   \boxed{p}_3 , \boxed{\neg r}_4  , \boxed{q}_5 , \boxed{\neg p \lor r}_6 ,\boxed{r}_7, \boxed{\square}_8$

### First order logic $PL_1$

- 1- Why FOL ?
  - using FOL, we can talk about individual objects, their properties, relation on object, function on objects. Existence of individual with a property, universitality of a property
- 2 - Syntax :
  - the FOL vocabulary $\sum_0$ contains :
    - connectives : $\sum^0$ (same as $PL^0$)
    - function constants : $\sum^f = {f,g,h}$
    - predicate constants : $\sum_p = {p,q,r}$
    - Skolem constants : $\sum_{sk}= {\dots}$
  - variable : $V_l = {X,Y,Z}$
  - Terms : 
    - $A \in wf_L(\sum_l,V_l)$  (A is a well formed term)
    - $V_l \in wf_L(\sum_l,V_l)$
    - $f(A^1,\dots,A^k) \in  wf_L(\sum_l,V_l)$ where $A_i \in wf_L(\sum_l,V_l)$
    - $p(A^1,\dots,A^k) \in wf_L(\sum_l,V_l) $
    - if $A,B \in wf_L(\sum_l,V_l), X \in V_l , \text{then},  T, A \land,\neg A, \forall X A \in wf_L(\sum_l,V_l) $
      - $\forall$ : universal quantifier
  - other propositions/ quantifiers can be derived using above :
    - $A \lor B = \neg (\neg A \land \neg B)$
    - $A \to B = \neg A \lor B$
    - $A \leftrightarrow B = (A \to B) \land (B \to A) $
    - $\exists X A = \neg (\forall X \neg A)$
  - formula without connective, quantifier = atomic , else complex
  - more about variables :
    -  bound
- 3 - Semantics
  - expressions are interpreted in a model $M = {D,I}$
  - D : Domain , set of non empty individual
  - I : interpretation function : assigns a value to every basic expression
  - interpretation:
    - $J()$
- 4 - Substitution
### Inference in First order logic


- 1 - Natural deduction by Gentzen
  -  Rules  : All rules of $PL_0$ + Rules for quantifiers
    - $\forall$  : $\boxed{ \forall_{I} :   \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A(\dots c \dots c \dots)$} \UnaryInfC{$\forall xA(\dots x \dots x \dots) $}  \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{  \forall_{E} : \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$\forall x A(\dots x \dots x \dots)$} \UnaryInfC{$A(\dots c \dots c \dots) $}  \end{prooftree} } $
      - elimination : we drop universal quantifier x by replacing every instance of x with c
      - introduction : this is tricky as we have to enumerate each and every possible value. so here take x as an arbitary value. restrictiopns : c must not exists in any undischarged assumptions and x must not occur in $A(c \dots)$
    - $\exists$ : $\boxed{ \exists_{I} :   \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$A(\dots c \dots c \dots)$} \UnaryInfC{$\exists x A(\dots x \dots c \dots) $}  \end{prooftree} }  \quad \boxed{  \exists{E} : \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{$\exists x A(\dots x \dots )$} \AxiomC{$[A(\dots c \dots)]$} \noLine \UnaryInfC{B} \BinaryInfC{B}  \end{prooftree} } $
      - intro : replaced the name c with a varaible x (given x does not occur in A). note we don't have to replace all c's
      - elim : restrictions : c must not occur in any undischarged assumptions before , c must not occur in $\exists x A(x \dots)$, c must not occur in B
- 2 - FOL with equality:
  - Intro :
  - Elimination : 
- 3 - Automated theorem proving
  - 1 - Tableaux
  - 2 - Resolution 
- 4 - Natural Deduction using Sequent Calculus

### Knowledge representation

- knowledge ladder :
  - different levels of info
  - chars --(add syntax)--> data --(add context)-->info--(add networking)-->knowledge
  - here we are concerned about using knowledge to support intellignet reasoning
- knowledge representation vs Data str
  - representation includes :
    - structure : what is the data ?
    - function : what do we do with the data?
  - data is simple /general
  - knowledge is complex and has a distinguished process model
- various paradigms of know rep:
  - good old fashioned AI : rep : symbolic ; process: based on huristic search
  - statistical : rep : symbolic ; procss : ML
  - connectionist : rep : sub symbolic, process: processing elements and weighted links
- how to evaluaute a good represenation ?
  - expressive adequacy : 
  - reasoning efficiency: can it gen result in acceptbale speeds 
  - primitives: what are the basic rep  
  - meta repr: knowl about knowl 
  - completeness 
- Semantic Network
- Sematic Web
- Logic based knowl rep
  - why :
  - challenges :
    - difficult to get world knowledge in symbolic repr
    - process models can be intractable 
  - desciption logic : logic based system that are expressive enough but still decidable
    - $PL_0$ as set description logic
- ALC
  - a simple Description logic
